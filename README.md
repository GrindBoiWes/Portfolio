# Portfolio
A portfolio displaying all forms of media

# Description
This portfolio was designed to let anyone who views this, into the world of Wes. This is intended to showcase my work, as well as projects I have been involved in. Art and design have been integral in my adulthood. Wether thats writing an album, or making videos for guitar pedal builders to promote on their Instagram pages and personal sites, I am always involving myself in some creative outlet. 

There are 5 main images that you will see on this page. Each of these pages will like you to seperate pages that correspond with that image. Websites will take you to my Github account, with all of my Repositories ready to view. Photography will link you to my Instagram account, where its a mix of Photography and Video. That page was initially dedicated to only guitar related content, but it has expanded over time. Video will link you to my Youtube account where you will find videos that are gear reviews on certain pedals, pickups etc.. The Music page will direct you to my current bands Bandcamp account. Finally, the gaming will link you to my TikTok which is a mostly video game related content at this point in time. All of the links in the navigation bar are also clickable and will redirect you to a new tab opening up the page.

At the bottom, you will see all of my contact info, as well as another link into my Github account. Thanks for viewing my portfolio!
